    "- The use of *extremely* inefficient or error-prone code (e.g., copy-pasting nearly identical commands rather than looping) may result in only partial credit.\n",

    "- Models that take hours to train on CPUs can be trained in just minutes when using GPUs.\n",
    "- **To avoid getting frustrated by having to re-train your models every time you run your notebook, you should save your trained model weights for later use.** Model history dictionaries can also be saved to disk with `pickle` and checked with an `if not` condition. This is a great way to check if the model weights exist before training, preventing redundant retraining. Please, think of the penguins! 🐧\n",

Please note that the `model.fit()` argument syntax is a little different when working with Datasets instead of numpy arrays; take a look at the [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#fit) documentation. Be sure to also pass the test data as validation data. When passing `train_rot_ds` to `.fit()`, you will find it useful to use pipelines to [batch](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#batch) the data. You can also experiment with [prefetching](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#prefetch) batches/elements from the dataset, which may allow you to speed up iterations by a few percent. Finally, while dry-running and prototyping your model, you may find it useful to [take](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#take) a subset of the data to speed up experimentation. However, your final model MUST be trained on all the available training data!
